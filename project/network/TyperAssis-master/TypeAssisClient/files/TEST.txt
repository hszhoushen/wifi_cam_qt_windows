(When the issue of wasting time arouses wide public concern from the public, can we still stand there, hesitating for what occurs?) As we can see from the depiction, a single person, sitting in front of a television that broadcasts some kinds of soap operas, is appreciating every nut and bolt of those invariable plots. Actually, this pictures is a Morning Call to send us a message that we human beings always perform something wasting much of precious time, thus idling youth away as every second elapses.(But my own worry today is less that of the overwhelming problem of common housewives or househusbands than it is of the slightly more luxurious agony of the decline in time managing ability even of the educated teenagers.) Several factors could weigh heavily for this degeneration, yet suspended at the top of the list are the following two aspects. To begin with, habit is habit. We are good at giving ourselves sufficient excuses to support what we always do in our daily life. If one example is needed, I could not but mention the following well-known scientist, whose name is Andrew D.C, illuminating that a kind of habit, representing a sense of spiritual existence, can never be changed as long as continuing for 47 days, nor is this kind of time-wasting practice. Furthermore, externally, our society is witnessing an overwhelming number of low-level TV programs, ranging from entertaining show, TV talk show and TV series to some other inferior products, which differ in forms as well as broadcasting time but never in their essential contents. Then, the consequence is distinct. It goes with no exaggeration to say that soap opera ruins the concept of cherishing time.Fortunately, that is not the Day of Judgment. It is, undoubtedly, the very time that we should take some available methods to end these inappropriate behaviors, including laying down the effective regulations to restrict the quantity of entertaining programs, shaping a moderate time outlook and guaranteeing more rational lifestyles.
